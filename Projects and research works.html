       <h3>Reduction in power on logic gates using virtual Power rails</h3>
       <p>The electrical zone is most engaged in power conversion in this regard. In most cases, regional developers in the global electronics areas build and use with the goal of improving data. This is true for analogue as well as digital circuits. Although the primary function of any circuit is to convey data, power and data are sometimes at the same level in the radio frequency field[1]. As the power costs rises, power supply becomes a significant reduced design issue. According to one leading company, the cost of producing power supplies will soon reach 70% of the total value of the standard electronic products it uses, such as a wireless or computer.. Therefore, the development of new technologies in power field is very important. So, power conversion and control itself, power sources are distinct and varied. It is only a resource, to consider how electronic circuits and models can be applied to the way of conversion and management. This is a framework for electronics power, a discipline defined in terms of power conservation, applications, and electrical equipment. Clearly, Converters (common name for DC-AC converters) and DC-DC power supply converters are also used in applications. power supplies represent the middle part where the main parts of the power systems, electrical, and control components meet and collaborates. Power electronics' distinctive qualities include their usage on big electronics equipment, the utilisation of storage devices, and particular control techniques for non-direct systems. Electrical appliances should be defined as digital, analog, and radio-frequency electronics in any study if we want to highlight their specific design approaches and problems[8].
        With technical enhancements up to 4 nm it is possible to obtain high performance in each part and performance has gained with throughput and delay[30]. As well as improving performance, electronics measurements have gained high power concentration, which is one of the limits to reduce physical size.With a transistor size of 170nm and up, the dynamic use of In order to obtain power consumption needs, IC

        has figured prominently. As transistors become smaller in size, the oxide thickness, gate length, and threshold voltage decrease, resulting in short-term impacts. This causes the transistor to operate incorrectly in the sub-threshold area. The lowering of the threshold voltage and the thickness of the oxide have a major effect on leakage current; it is obvious that the reduction of the line at the threshold voltage results in a gain in leakage capacity.

        <h3>Lossless Audio using PARCOR </h3>
        <p>This Project Focuses on the lossless audio compression tools , which utilizes a pre- processing procedure for flattening the amplitude envelope for a linear prediction residue, and an arithmetic encoder that adopt the scaled probability template.
            Generally , the multimedia contents are pre- compressed before they are uploaded online .Normally there are two types of compression methods: the lossy and the lossless. The lossy method attempts to remove perpetually less important information from the audio data while keeping the sound quality very close to original one. Some example that includes this type of compression method are: MPEG-1 Layer(MP3) and MPEG-2/4 Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) which achieve more than 20 times compression and still delivering good sound Quality. On the other hand, the lossless Method keeps every bit of information from the original audio data and can achieve about two times compression.
            Lossy audio compression is mainly used for playing music from iPods, or listening to networked radio using mobile phones. In contrast, lossless audio reproduction, archival of database and more recently biomedical signal compression, such as lossless ECG compression.A generally approach used in lossless audio compression, is a combination of linear prediction and entropy encoding. The linear prediction first removes the redundancy in the input data and generates a prediction residue, and an entropy encoder that is based on a LPC predictor , a pre-processor for flattening the prediction residue, and an entropy coder that is based on arithmetic coding with probability template scaling.</p>
        <h3>Netwoek Clustering of Nodes using LEACH Protocol</h3>
        <p>In Wireless Sensor Networks routing of nodes in a large Area is a complicated Process especially if there has to be a routung based on clustering at different stages and levels.
            For example we can relate this problem to a general mobile phone networking or telephony networking.
            In that case the location of the cell has to contact the cell which is located on a different location so that process is conducted in different stages.In This project we have a certain problem in which we have an area of grid say 200x200 and 200 nodes deployed in that area . The problem is to jump the signal from one node to another till t reaches the sink. Also there has to be a master node for each cluster region which and only which can send data to the sink as its predefined range of transmission is more than of a node,Also this multi hop transmission of data should be energy efficient so there has to be a rotaion of cluster head so that the enery of a particular node could not be exhausted for that purpose this program uses the concept of EESAA (Energy Efficient Sleep awake Aware)
            in which we evaluate and enhance certain issues like network stability, network lifetime and cluster head selection process. Based on the energy required to transmitt the signal and the energy which is left to the node.</p>
